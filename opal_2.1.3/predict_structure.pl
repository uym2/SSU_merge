#            with the format required by Opal

Using predict_structure.pl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

predict_structure.pl --in <sequences.fasta> (others)

  Options:
    -help          brief help message
    -man           full documentation
    -in            input fasta file
    -out           output structure file (Opal input format)
    -tmpdir        directory in which temporary directory is formed    


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8


=item B<--out <structure_file>>

File in which the Opal-formatted secondary structure is stored. If none 
is entered, the default is to use a modification of the name of the 
fasta file containing the input sequences. The new file will have the 
extension .ss. If the input file contains the extension  "fasta" or "fa",
that extension will be removed.  
(e.g. filename.fa --> filename.ss;  filename.seqs --> filename.seqs.ss) 


=item B<--tmpdir <temporary_directory>>

Directory (x) in which a temporary directory (y) will be placed. 
Temporary psipred files will be stored in directory x/y, which 
is removed at the completion of processing. If none is chosen, a 
random one will be generated in the current working directory 


=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<predict_structure.pl> takes as input a sequence file in fasta format. 
For each sequence in the file, psipred_single is run. The results of these
psipred runs are merged into a single file with the format required by Opal
